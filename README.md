`rf` is a terminal-based RSS/Atom feed reader, slightly reminiscent of [a certain '80s-era Usenet news reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_(newsreader)).

I wrote this small feed reader because I was unhappy with my Web-based options.

# Features

- Largely terminal-based; no Web bloat, though you can open articles in the browser;
- Cross-post to Hacker News;
- Single-keystroke-driven;
- Fetch all feeds in parallel to minimize latency;
- Workflow similar in feel to [`rn`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_(newsreader)) (you may have to be over 50 and/or have other problems for this to have any appeal);
- Configurable JSON list of feeds (coming soon: add/remove subscriptions through the program itself);
- Provide plain-text preview of text contents inline, similar to a venerable Usenet news reader (*IN PROGRESS / BETA*).

# Implementation

Implemented in Go.  Currently the `o` and `H` commands only work on MacOS.  PRs for other platforms will be enthusiastically reviewed.

# Build

Check out this repo, then

    go build .

I'll set up `go get` eventually.

## Feed Configuration

Currently, you have to add feeds manually by creating `.rffeeds.json` 
in your home directory.  Example:

	[
		{
			"name": "PG",
			"url": "http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feeds/pgessays.rss",
			"type": "rss"
		},
		{
			"name": "MATT",
			"url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/atom.xml",
			"type": "atom"
		}
	]
